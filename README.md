# CloudBedlam for Linux (Mono or .NET Core)

#### Simple, configurable, local (VM internal) chaotic operation orchestrator for measuring the resiliency of cloud services by injecting bedlam (physical resource pressure and network faults via emulation) into underlying virtual machines. This version is meant to run inside Linux VMs (and containers).


### Easy to use 

Step 0.

Just change XML settings to meet your specific chaotic needs. The default config will run CPU, Memory and Networking chaos. You can remove the CPU and Memory nodes and just do Network emulation or remove Network and just do CPU/Mem. It's configurable, so do what you want! 

For example, the below configuration XML runs a CPU pressure fault of 90% CPU utilization across all CPUs for 15 seconds, Memory pressure fault eating 90% of available memory for 15 seconds, and Network Latency emulation fault of 3000ms delay for 30 seconds for specified endpoints only..., 2 times successively (Repeat=‚Äù1‚Äù).
<pre><code>
&lt;ChaosConfiguration Orchestration="Sequential" Duration="60" RunDelay="0" Repeat="1"&gt;
	&lt;CpuPressure RunOrder="0"&gt;
        	&lt;PressureLevel&gt;90&lt;/PressureLevel&gt;
        	&lt;Duration&gt;15&lt;/Duration&gt;
	&lt;/CpuPressure&gt;
	&lt;MemoryPressure RunOrder="1"&gt;
        	&lt;PressureLevel&gt;70&lt;/PressureLevel&gt;
        	&lt;Duration&gt;15&lt;/Duration&gt;
	&lt;/MemoryPressure&gt;
	&lt;NetworkEmulation RunOrder="2"&gt;
		&lt;EmulationType&gt;Latency&lt;/EmulationType&gt;
		&lt;LatencyDelay&gt;3000&lt;/LatencyDelay&gt;
		&lt;TargetEndpoints&gt;
			&lt;Endpoint Port="443" Uri="https://www.bing.com" /&gt;
			&lt;Endpoint Port="80" Uri="http://www.msn.com" /&gt;
			&lt;Endpoint Port="443" Uri="https://www.google.com" /&gt;
		&lt;/TargetEndpoints&gt;
		&lt;Duration&gt;30&lt;/Duration&gt;
	&lt;/NetworkEmulation&gt;
&lt;/ChaosConfiguration&gt;
</code></pre>

Step 1. (Mono)

Launch CloudBedlam running as sudo:

      sudo mono CloudBedlam.exe

Have fun and hopefully this proves useful to you in your service resiliency testing. It should be clear that this is a development tool at this stage and not a DevOps workflow orchestrator. You should run this in individual VMs to vet the quality of your code in terms of resiliency and fault tolerance.

Of course, please help make this better üòä ‚Äì and add whatever you need around and inside the core chaos engine (which is what this is, really). It may be useful for you to develop a way to deploy configs to local CloudBedlam instances from some remote trusted service (where each side of the secure (443) connection provably trusts the other (shared public key, etc...)). CloudBedlam "agents" would communicate and authenticate with a central Bedlam service which would send down configs that define specific chaos operations for specific sets of VMs in your service(s). Push-based (reactive) interaction with agents would be very cool. 

Obviousy, having a remote-controlled chaotic orchestrator where you can run different tests on different VMs from a central service would be a scalable approach. Like all things in engineering, it comes with a cost, across security and complexity... 

We made this *very simple chaos tool* with a VM-specific approach in mind *specifically to remove the overhead of a distributed secure server-client-agent model*. The focus for us is on making a *very easy to use, simple to configure, lightweight solution for chaos engineering and experimentation inside virtual machines*.


Make chaos, not war!
